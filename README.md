# Marketplace Engine — Configurable Two-Sided Platform

This project was created with ScopesFlow automation.

## Setup

Install dependencies (include devDependencies for build and dev server):

```bash
npm install
```

If you use `NODE_ENV=production` in your environment, install dev dependencies explicitly for local development:

```bash
npm install --include=dev
```
